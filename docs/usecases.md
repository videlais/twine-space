# Use Cases

To better understand our potential audiences, we created three user stories to capture functionality for **Twine Space**:

* *I am a reader. I want to see simple 3D models in my interactive fiction.*

* *I have a mobile device in a specific space. I want to see locative image markers as part of my interactive fiction experience.*

* *I am a teacher. I want to work with my students to create simple AR experiences in a classroom using Twine.*
