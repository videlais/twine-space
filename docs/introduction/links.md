# Links

The connection of one passage to another is named a **link**. This term is borrowed from hypertext and describes the creation of a hyper*link* within the page from one section to another. In Twine, rather than move to the other location, the currently showing content is replaced with another or another effect occurs.

Links can be created four ways:

* Passage name: `[[Link to another passage]]`.
* Using the pipe, "|", to rename a link from its original to some other name for the same purpose: `[[Link to another passage|Different Passage]]`.
* Using arrows to point to the location: `[[Link to another passage->Different Passage]]` or `[[Different Passage<-Link to another passage]]`.
