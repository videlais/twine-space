# Interactive Stories

Twine is a hypertext authoring tool. It produces HTML (HyperText Markup Language) files. These can be played in web browsers and other, similar tools.

## Non-linear storytelling

Unlike a physical book where pages are arranged and accessed in order from the beginning to the end, HTML allows for non-linear access. This means the sections of a file can be accessed in an order not strictly defined.

When we move from one website to another using a web browser, we experience this same progress. As we can use Twine to design this experience, we can define different sections (what Twine names passages) and how a potential future person would move between them. Borrowing from an existing term in hypertext, Twine uses links, connections between passages, to describe the relationship between one section and another.

Because we define the passages and the links, an author can define different structures within the experience such as loops and deadlines as a future person moves through the experience.

## Stories of passages

Each project in Twine is named a story. It is composed of one or more passages. Each of these different sections, passages, can include special content affecting how it would be shown to someone experiencing the story.

The name of this special content is Markdown. This takes its name from a slight pun of the word *markup*. It is supposed to be easier to *down* than *up*.

In Markdown, extra symbols like two asterisks around a word or phrase will change how it presented and give it a **strong emphasis**. The hash can also be used to define different headings connected to HTML.
